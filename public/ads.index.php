        'description'   =>"This guitar was purchased from the original owner who was in his late 60's.  He indicated  that he purchased this guitar brand new in the mid-60s.  At some point in the mid to late 70s he told me that he refinished the guitar and changed the color from a RED to white.  He also played it a lot and in doing so it had quite a few scratches, dents and dings.  Two of the tuning pegs were broken; however, they still worked and properly tuned the guitar.  The electronics were scratchy and needed to be cleaned as well.  It was 99.999% original with the exception of the headstock LOGO which was missing.  I wanted to bring this guitar back to its original color which was determined to be Dakota Red by the guys at Chicago Fretworks.  They completely refinished this guitar, cleaned the electronics, installed new period correct tuners and repainted it the original color which was Dakota Red, installed a new Headstock LOGO, cleaned the fretboard, and installed new strings.  This cost me over $700; however, this guitar sounds awesome and plays like butter!!! I also have the receipt for the work done on this guitar."
